# 👋 Hello there! I'm Abdul-Azeem

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate and curious programmer who sees code as both a craft and a calling. My journey into tech was fueled by a deep fascination with how computers think, compute, and connect—this spark has since grown into a fire that fuels my daily grind as a developer.

## 💻 Who I Am
With hands-on experience in PHP, Node.js, and Java, I'm constantly exploring the powerful frameworks that help bring ideas to life—Laravel and Express have been my go-to tools, and I'm currently diving into Spring Boot to expand my backend arsenal. My work spans exciting real-world projects: I'm actively building an e-commerce platform at **Klemweb**, and I'm also helping shape a startup project that bridges the gap between **artisans and customers**—creating digital opportunities where none existed before.

## 🧰 What I Work With
Here’s a peek into the tools and technologies I engage with regularly:
- **Languages:** PHP, Node.js, Java  
- **Frameworks:** Laravel, Express, Spring Boot (soon!)  
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite  
- **Others:** Eager to grow in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

## 🧠 How I Think
My fascination with computing goes beyond syntax. I see programming as problem-solving with purpose. Recently, I’ve taken up **chess**, and it’s transforming the way I approach logic, patience, and pattern recognition. It's like debugging with pawns and knights—and it’s become my mental gym.

## 🛠️ Current Projects
- 🛒 **E-Commerce Platform @ Klemweb:** Building a smooth and scalable system for online transactions  
- 🤝 **Artisan-Customer Connector (Startup):** Empowering local service providers through tech-driven matchmaking

## 🚀 My Growth Path
- Strengthening skills in DSA for better algorithmic thinking  
- Expanding my knowledge of Spring Boot and enterprise-level Java  
- Exploring cloud services and deployment strategies in future work
